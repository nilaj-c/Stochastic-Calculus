Repository for codes on stochastic calculus problems. 
1. wiener-process - Defined a function which prints out the time course of a wiener process using a normal random number generator. Demonstrate plots of sample paths. 
2. ornstein-uhlenbeck - Simulated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is a mean reverting Stochastic Differential Equation. Demonstrated plots of sample paths. Obtained the mean and variance analytically and compared it with the simulation results.
