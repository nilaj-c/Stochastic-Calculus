# Stochastic-Calculus
Repository for codes on stochastic calculus problems. 
1. wiener-process - Defined a function which prints out the time course of a wiener process using a normal random number generator. Demonstrate plots of sample paths.
2. gbm-stock-price - Simulated the Geometric Brownian Equation. Calculated historical mean and volatility of returns of Microsoft stock. Simulated price paths using these parameters. Compared the analytic solution and the SDE solution and the mean and variance of the solutions with analytic results.
3. ornstein-uhlenbeck - Simulated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is a mean reverting Stochastic Differential Equation. Demonstrated plots of sample paths. Obtained the mean and variance analytically and compared it with the simulation results.
